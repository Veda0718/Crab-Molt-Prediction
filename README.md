# Unlocking the Crab's Mystery: Predicting Pre-Molting Size

## Project Overview
This project delves into the intriguing phenomenon of crab molting, analyzing a dataset from Washington State to understand the variations in crab sizes before and after molting. Through statistical analysis and predictive modeling, the study aims to unravel the secrets of crab growth dynamics and its ecological implications.

## Key Questions
 - How do crab sizes vary before and after molting, and what factors influence this variation?
 - Do the sizes of crabs before and after molting follow a normal distribution, and what causes deviations from this pattern?
 - How does the regression model explain the relationship between pre-molt and post-molt sizes, and what does this reveal about crab growth?
 - What do the residual patterns in the predictive model suggest about its accuracy and potential nonlinear growth patterns?
 - Does the location where crabs molt (field vs. lab) affect their size changes?

## Findings
 - Significant increase in crab size post-molt, with an average difference of 15 mm observed.
 - Deviations from normality in both pre-molt and post-molt size distributions, suggesting complex underlying factors influencing crab sizes.
 - Linear regression models exhibit a strong correlation between pre-molt and post-molt sizes, with post-molt data accurately predicting pre-molt data at 98% accuracy.
 - Significant variations in residual patterns, indicating variance in the data and potential nonlinear growth patterns.
 - Differences in regression model outcomes between lab and field data suggest environmental influences on the molting process.

## Conclusion
The study sheds light on the intricate interplay between molting, crab growth, and environmental factors, offering valuable insights for understanding crab development and its ecological implications. These findings can inform conservation strategies and management practices to support successful molting and preserve crab populations in natural and aquaculture environments.
